# Fast Fourier Transform

Fast Fourier Transform is an incredibly usefull algorithm that is part of the most
Kilby maintain this library in order to make sure

There are multiple different architectures that enable performing FFT through software in a defined type of hardware or different types of hardwares.
ASIC and FPGA is one of the focus on Kilby works and it will likely have more RTL code than SW.
The goal is not only providing multiple options of FFT but making clear their trade-offs between latency, throughput, area, and power consumption.
